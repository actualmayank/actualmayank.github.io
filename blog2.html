  <h1 class="blog-title">Cloning a Website Taught Me More Than 4 College Semesters</h1>

  <div class="blog-content">
    <p>Not even kidding, I made this entire website in just one day.<br />
      Yeah, one single day, with the help of YouTube and AI.</p>

    <p>Honestly, these two have taught me way more than any school or college I‚Äôve been to.  
      And I genuinely mean it.  
      The real stuff, the practical knowledge, the things I was actually curious about,  
      I found all of that online, not in some classroom with chalk and dust and rules.</p>

    <p>I genuinely feel like schools and colleges need to rethink how they teach.  
      They need to level up and start focusing on what students are actually interested in.  
      All these group projects, random assignments, and semester exams feel so unnecessary most of the time.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm not saying every subject is useless. Every subject has its own value, sure.  
      But forcing students to go deep into topics they‚Äôll never use in life makes no sense.</p>

    <p>Why should someone who‚Äôs passionate about filmmaking or business be made to study the depths of advanced math or inorganic chemistry?  
      Basics are fine, they help. But beyond that, it just feels like a waste of time.</p>

    <p>I once came across Elon Musk‚Äôs school, Astra Nova, and the concept blew my mind.  
      They focus only on what actually matters. STEM‚ÄîScience, Technology, Engineering, and Maths.  
      That‚Äôs it. No unnecessary drama. Just pure, useful learning.  
      Imagine getting to study engineering from childhood if that‚Äôs where your interest lies.  
      That sounds like a dream compared to what most of us go through.</p>

    <p>And let‚Äôs be honest, half the professors in our colleges don‚Äôt even fully understand the subjects they‚Äôre teaching.  
      I‚Äôve literally seen some of them watch tutorial videos on YouTube right before class  
      when they connect their laptops to the projector.  
      It‚Äôs both funny and sad at the same time.</p>

    <p>I wish schools and colleges in India were better.  
      I wish they actually cared about what students want to learn.  
      But till then, we make do.  
      We explore, we learn on our own, and we try to build something meaningful.</p>

    <p>That‚Äôs all for now.<br />Adios.</p>
